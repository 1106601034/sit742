        "is free language text. Given the amount of information stored as text on the Internet, it is not feasible for a human to manually explore such a large amount of text data to extract useful information. Therefore, we have to use automatic approaches, such as text analysis algorithms developed in the fields of text mining, natural language process (NLP) and information retrieval (IR). It is worth knowing that computers cannot directly understand text like humans. For example, humans can automatically break down sentences into units of meaning, but computers cannot. Therefore, text data must be processed before various text analysis algorithms can use it.\n",

        "Unlike the data you can retrieve from relational databases, text data always appears in an unstructured form.\n",
        "By unstructured we mean that text data exists \"in the wild\" and has not been converted into a structured format, like a spreadsheet. Therefore, it has to be manipulated and converted into a proper structured and numerical format consumable by text analysis algorithms, which is referred to as text pre-processing. It is an important task and a critical step in text analysis. The characters, words and sentences identified by text pre-processing are the fundamental units passed to all the downstream text analysis algorithms, such as part-of-speech tagging, parsing, document classification and clustering, etc.\n",

        "\n",
        "Text is usually represented as sequences of characters by computers. \n",
        "However, most natural language processing (NLP) and text mining tasks\n",
        "(e.g., parsing, information extraction, machine translation, document classification, information\n",
        "retrieval, etc.) need to operate on tokens. \n",
        "The process of breaking a stream of text into tokens is often referred to as **tokenization**.\n",
        "For example, a tokenizer turns a string such as \n",
        "```\n",
        "    A data wrangler is the person performing the wrangling tasks.\n",
        "```\n",
        "into a sequence of tokens such as\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "There is no single right way to do tokenization. \n",
        "It completely depends on the corpus and the text analysis task you are going to perform. It is important to ensure that your tokenizer produces proper token types for your downstream text analysis tools. \n",
        "Although word tokenization is relatively easy compared with other NLP or text mining task, errors made in this phase will propagate into later analysis and cause problems.\n",
        "In this section, we will demonstrate the process of chopping character sequences into pieces with different tokenizers. \n",
        "\n",
        "The major question of the tokenization phase is what counts as a token.\n",
        "Different linguistic analyses might have different notions of tokens.\n",
        "In different languages, a token could mean different things. \n",
        "Here we are not going to dive into the linguistic aspect of what counts as a token,\n",
        "as it goes beyond the scope of this unit.\n",
        "We rather consider English text.\n",
        "**In English, a token can be a string of alphanumeric characters separated by spaces, which\n",
        "seems quite easy.**\n",
        "However, things get considerably worse when we start considering words having\n",
        "hyphens, apostrophes, periods and so on. In a word tokenization task, should we\n",
        "remove hyphens? Should we keep periods? \n",
        "According to different text analysis tasks, \n",
        "tokens can be unigram words, multi-word phrases (or collocations), or \n",
        "other meaningful and identifiable linguistic elements.\n",
        "Therefore, working out word tokens is not an easy task in pre-processing natural language text.\n",

        "\n",
        "Word tokens are not always surrounded by whitespace characters. Punctuation, such as commas, semicolons, and periods, are often used in English, as they are vital to disambiguate the meaning of sentences. However, it is problematic for computers to handle punctuation, especially periods, properly in tokenization. \n",
        "In this part we will focus on the handling of periods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Periods are usually used to mark the end of sentences. Difficulty arises when the period marks abbreviations (including acronyms). Please refer to **\"Step 2: Handling Abbreviations\" in [3]** for a detailed discussion on abbreviations.  In the case of abbreviations, particularly acronyms, separating tokens on punctuation and other non-alphanumeric characters would put different components of the acronym into different tokens, as you have seen in our example, where \"U.S.A\" has been put into three tokens, \"U\", \"S\" and \"A\", losing the meaning of the acronym. To deal with abbreviations, one approach is to maintain a look-up list of known abbreviations during tokenization. Another approach aims for smart tokenization. Here we will show you how to use regular expressions to cover most but not all abbreviations.\n",
        "\n",
        "An acronym is often formed from the initial components in multi-word phrases.  Some contains periods, and some do not. Common acronyms with periods are for example, \n",
        "* U.S.A\n",
        "* U.N.\n",
        "* U.K.\n",
        "* B.B.C\n",
        "\n",
        "Other abbreviations with a similar pattern are, for instance, \n",

        "* A.D. and B.C.\n",
        "* O.K.\n",
        "* i.e.\n",
        "* e.g.\n",
        "\n",
        "For abbreviations like those, it is not hard to figure out the pattern and the corresponding regular expression.  Each of those abbreviations contains at least a pair of a letter (either uppercase or lowercase) and a period.  The regular expression is\n",

        "#### 2.1.4 Hyphens and Apostrophes \n",
        "\n",
        "In English, hyphenation is used for various purposes. The hyphen can be used to form certain compound terms, including hyphenated compound nouns, verbs and adjectives. It can also be used for word division. There are many sources of hyphens in texts. Thus, should one count a sequence of letters with a hyphen as one word to two? Unfortunately, the answer seems to be sometimes one, sometimes two. \n",
        "For example, if the hyphen is used to split up vowels in words, such as \"co-operate\", \"co-education\" and \"pre-process\", these words should be regarded as single token. In contrast, if the hyphen is used to group a couple of words together, for example, \"a state-of-the-art algorithm\" and \"a money-back guarantee\", these hyphenated words should be separated into individual words.\n",
        "Therefore, handling hyphenated words automatically is one of the most difficult tasks in pre-processing text data.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"**The Art of Tokenization**\" (Please refer the Part 4, Reading Materials) categorizes different hyphens into three types:\n",
        "* **End-of-Line Hyphen**: In professionally printed material (like books, and newspapers), the hyphen is used to divide words between the end of one line and the beginning of the next in order to perform justification of text during typesetting. It seems to be easy to handle these kinds of hyphens by simply removing them and joining the parts of a word at the end of one line and the beginning of the next.\n",
        "* **Lexical Hyphen**: Words with a lexical hyphen are better to be treated as a single word. They are typically included in a dictionary. For example, words contains certain prefixes, like \"co-\", \"pre-\", \"multi-\", etc., and other words like \"so-called\", \"forty-two\"\n",
        "* **Sententially Determined Hyphenation**: This type of hyphen is often created dynamically. It includes, for example, nouns modified by an 'ed'-verb (e.g., \"text-based\" and \"hand-made\") and sequences of words used as a modifier in a noun group, as in \"the 50-cent-an-hour raise\". In these cases, we might want to treat those tokens joined by hyphens as individual words.\n",
        "\n",
        "The use of hyphens in many such cases is extremely inconsistent, which further increase the complexity of dealing with hyphens in tokenization. People often resort to using either some heuristic rules or treating it as a machine learning problem. However, these go beyond our scope here. It is clear that handling hyphenation is much more complicated than one can expect. You should also be clear that there is no way of handling all the cases above.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's assume that we are going to treat all strings of two words separated by a hyphen as a single token, how can we extract them from texts without breaking them into pieces.  In our example text, we are going to view \"ASX-listed\" as a single token. The pattern here is  a sequence of alphanumeric character plus \"-\" and plus another sequence of alphanumeric character.\n",

        ">Sentence boundary disambiguation (SBD), also known as sentence breaking, is the problem in natural language processing of deciding where sentences begin and end. Often natural language processing tools require their input to be divided into sentences for a number of reasons. However sentence boundary identification is challenging because punctuation marks are often ambiguous. For example, a period may denote an abbreviation, decimal point, an ellipsis, or an email address - not the end of a sentence. About 47% of the periods in the Wall Street Journal corpus denote abbreviations. As well, question marks and exclamation marks may appear in embedded quotations, emoticons, computer code, and slang.\n",
        "\n",
        "SBD is one of the essential problems for many NLP tasks, like Parsing, Information Extraction, Machine Translation, and Document Summarizations. \n",
        "The accuracy of the SBD system will directly affect the performance of these applications. \n",
        "\n",
        "Sentences are the basic textual unit immediately above the word and phrase. \n",
        "So what is a sentence? Is something ending with one of the following punctuations \".\", \"!\", \"?\"?\n",
        "Does a period always indicate sentence boundaries?\n",
        "For English texts, it is almost as easy as finding every occurrence of those punctuations.\n",
        "However, some periods occur as part of abbreviations, monetary numerals and percentages, as we \n",
        "have discussed in sections 1.2 and 1.3. \n",
        "Although you can use a few heuristic rules to correctly\n",
        "identify the majority of sentence boundaries, SBD is much more complex that we can expect,\n",
        "please read section 4.2.4 of the book, 'Corpus-Based Work'  refered on the Part 4 Reading Materials, and watch a Youtube video on [Sentence segmentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LXq3oQEEIA). \n",
