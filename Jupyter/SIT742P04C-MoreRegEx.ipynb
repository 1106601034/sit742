Summary\n* Part 5. Exercises\n\n---\n\n\nGetting a specific piece of text from a large block of text is a very challenging problem in parsing data.\nIn various programming languages there are built-in string functions available for \nsearching and replacing. For example, the [common string operations](https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html) built in Python. \nHowever, these methods are limited to simplest cases. For example, the `string.find()` method in Python \nreturns the lowest index of the matched substring in a given string.\nIn more complex cases, such as data validation, where you are going to test an string to see if a telephone number pattern occurs within the string, it could result in code containing a stack of \n`if` statements by using different Python's built-in string functions.\nTo simplify the code and make it more readable, you might need to move up to [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression). So what is a regular expression?\n\n> \"A regular expression is a pattern which specifies a set of strings of characters; it is said to match certain strings.\"--- Ken Thompson\n\nIf you've ever typed `cp *.ipynb ../module_2/` at the UNIX command prompt, or entered \"match?\" into a web-based search engine, you've already used a simple regular expression. In the first instance, you've copied all the files which end with file extension \".ipynb\" (as opposed to copying them one by one); in the second, you've conducted a search not only for \"match,\" but also for \"matches\", \"matching\", \"matched\", and \"matcher\" all at once.\nUsing a well-crafted regular expression, you can easily search through a large number of text files, searching for words ending with \"ed\", replace the .html suffix with a .xml suffix, and then change all the lower case characters to upper case. \n\nRegular expressions (Regex) are all about matching and finding patterns in text, from simple patterns to the very complex ones.\nFor instance, they can be simple as this:\n```python\n    \\d\n```\nA character shorthand that matches any digit from 0 to 9.\nThey can also be something a bit more complicated like \n```python\n(19|20)\\d\\d[- /.](0[1-9]|1[012])[- /.](0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])\n```\nwhich is where we will wind up at the end of this chapter: a fairly robust regular expression\nthat matches a date in yyyy-mm-dd format from between 1900-01-01 and 2099-12-31, with a choice of four separators, which are '-', ' ', '/' and '.'. This regular expression can be visualised as\n\n![regEx](https://github.com/tulip-lab/sit742/raw/master/Jupyter/image/regeximg1.png)\n\n\nIf you are an experienced Regex user, this seems simple and straightforward.\nHowever, if you are new to Regex or aren't exprienced enough, it takes a while to understand it. \nDon't worry if you don't get how that all works. \nWe will show you how to develop regular expressions step-by-step in this chapter.\nIf you just follow the examples, writing regular expression will eventually turn out to be not \nthat hard. To quickly review some regular expression syntax:\n\n\n* <font color=\"red\">[0-9]</font> Matches a single digit\n* <font color=\"red\">[a-z0-9]</font> Matches a single character that must be a lower case letter or a digit.\n* <font color=\"red\">[A-Za-z]</font> Matches a single character that much be a upper/lower case letter \n* <font color=\"red\">\\d</font> Matches any decimal digit; equivalent to the set [0-9].\n* <font color=\"red\">\\D</font> Matches characters that are not digits, which is equivalent to [^0-9] or [^\\d].\n* <font color=\"red\">\\w</font> Matches any alphanumeric character, which is equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9].\n* <font color=\"red\">\\W</font> Matches any non-alphanumeric character; which is equivalent to [^a-zA-Z0-9] or [^\\w].\n* <font color=\"red\">\\s</font> Matches any whitespace character; which is equivalent to [\\t\\n\\r\\f\\v], where \\t indicates taps, \\n  line feeds, \\r carriage returns, \\f form feeds and \\v vertical tabs.\n* <font color=\"red\">\\S:</font> Matches any non-whitespace character; which is equivalent to  [^ \\t\\n\\r\\f\\v].\n* <font color=\"red\">\u02c6</font> Matches the start of the line.\n* <font color=\"red\">$</font> Matches the end of the line.\n* <font color=\"red\">.</font> Matches any character (a wildcard).\n* <font color=\"red\">*</font> Matches when the preceding character occurs zero or more times\n* <font color=\"red\">?</font> Matches when the preceding character occurs zero or one times\n* <font color=\"red\">+</font> Matches when the preceding character occurs one or more times\n\nMore information can be found here :\nhttps://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html\n\n* * *\n\n- - -",

Regular Expressions\n\nAs a powerful way of searching, replacing, and parsing text with complex patterns of characters, regular expressions are the most significant tools in data parsing. They figure into all kinds of text-manipulation tasks. Searching and search-and-replace are among the most common uses. Regular expressions tend to be easier to write than they are to read. This is less of a problem if you are the only one who ever needs to maintain them. But if several people need to, the syntax can turn into more of a hindrance than an aid. For example,\n```python\n    ^(|(([A-Za-z0-9]+_+)|([A-Za-z0-9]+\\-+)|([A-Za-z0-9]+\\.+)|([A-Za-z0-9]+\\++))*[A-Za-z0-9]+@((\\w+\\-+)|(\\w+\\.))*\\w{1,63}\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6})$\n```\nis a regular expression for validating email addresses.\nPlease don't try to parse it yourself, \nsince an experienced regular expression user might take a while to parse it.\nIn this section, we will first go through some good introductory materials of regular expressions,\nand then show you some fundamentals of how to use regular expressions in search text.\n\nThere are a couple of good online materials that introduce regular expressions in Python. \nWe strongly suggest that you study this chapter together with these materials. \nThey are \n* [Regular Expression HOWTO](https://docs.python.org/2/howto/regex.html) from Python's office website: An introductory tutorial to using regular expressions in Python with the `re` module. \ud83d\udcd6\n* [Regular Expressions](http://www.diveintopython3.net/regular-expressions.html), chapter 5 of \"**Dive into Python 3**\": A series of examples inspired by real world problems are used to show you how to generate regular expressions for parsing street name, Roman numerals, and phone numbers. \ud83d\udcd6\n\nThe complete list of meta-characters and their behaviour in the context of regular expressions can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html). Besides, there is an alternative material if you would like to view, which is \n\n* [RegexOne](http://regexone.com): An interactive tutorial on learning regular expressions with simple exercises.\n\nBefore we go through some basics of regular expressions in python, we would like to point out [RegExr](http://regexr.com) by Grant Skinner. It is an online tool to learn, build, & test regular expressions. RegExr provides us with syntax highlighting, contextual help, video tutorial, reference, and searchable community patterns.\nYou will find a lot of good information in the six tabs provides on its website. In addition, pop-ups appear when you hover over the regular expression or target text in RegExr, giving you helpful information linking you between a regular expression and the corresponding matches in text. \nThese resources are one of the reasons why RegExr is among our favourite online Regex checkers.",

Raw Strings in Python Regular Expressions\nWe have been using 'r' in our regular expressions, what does it mean?\nIt is Python's raw string notation for regular expressions.\nIt has been used to work around the backslash plague.\n\nIn regular expressions the backslash character ('\\')  is often used to escape characters that otherwise have a special meaning, such as newline, backslash itself, or the quote character. For example, to match a literal backslash, one has to write '\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' as the regular expression string. This is because the regular expression must be '\\\\\\\\', and each backslash must be expressed as '\\\\\\\\' inside a regular Python string literal. Let's assume that you would like find all the LaTeX commands in a given LaTeX file. Those commands always start with a backslash, like '\\\\usepackage',\n'\\\\section', '\\\\title', etc. The regular expression without raw string notation is:\n```python\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\w+\n```\nRefer to the previous section for the meaning of \"\\w\".\nIn contrast, one can prefiex the string literals with a letter 'r' or 'R' to form a raw string notation, which tells \nthe regular expression engine not to handle backslashes in any special way.

Case Study (1) - Parsing Dates with Regular Expressions\n\n\nThis section will show you how to parse dates in simple data formats, \ne.g., mm/dd/yyyy, and dd/mm/yyyy. You might think that something as conceptually trivial as a date should be an easy job for a regular expression. But it isn\u2019t, for reasons like: \n* The problem of leading zeros: humans are very sloppy with writing dates. Sometimes we omit the leading zeros, and write dates like \"1/1/2016\" and \"1/01/2016\". Therefore, should the regular expression for dates allow leading zeros to be omitted?\n* Different date delimiters: besides forward slashes, we can also use white spaces, or hyphens to separate day, month and year.\n* Matching a given range of numbers: regular expressions don't deal directly with numbers and don't understand the numerical meanings that humans assign to strings of digits. They treat numbers, like 123, as strings of characters displayed as digits, 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, we cannot tell a regular expression to match a given range of numbers directly. For instance, to match months that are in a range from 1 to 12 and to match days from 1 to 31.\n\nTherefore, you have to choose how simple or how accurate you want your regular expression to be.\nIf you already know your text doesn\u2019t contain any invalid dates, you could use a trivial regex such as\n```python\n    r\"\\d{2}/\\d{2}/\\d{4}\"\n```\nThe fact that this matches things like 00/00/0000 is irrelevant if those don\u2019t occur in your text.\nIn most cases, you won't know whether your text has invalid dates or not. \n\nSo given that a basic date is day, month and year, and are all digits, which of the three is easiest to parse with regular expressions?\nGive month a try.

Summary\n\nThis chapter has discussed the fundamentals of regular expressions.\nYou have learnt how to develop regular expressions for handling street addresses, Roman numerals, phone numbers, and dates. Regular expressions may not be suitable for dealing with complex XML files but the basic idea that a regular expression can block anything that doesn't match is both useful and powerful. You might use regular expressions, for example, as the basis for a short program that filters incoming spam in your email. In this case, the program might use a regular expression to determine whether the name of a known spammer appeared in the \"From:\" line of the email. Email filtering programs, in fact, very often use regular expressions for exactly this type of operation. You will further learn regular expressions in Module 6 on text pre-processing. It is worth noting that regular expressions are not specific to Python. Many other programming languages also provide regular expression capabilities, for example, Perl, Java, Ruby, etc. Finally, do you think it's possibly to do Data Wrangling without regular expressions?\n\n---\n\nWatch the Software Carpentry lecture on regular expressions, if you need more help.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7C1EB31127AB8A0B\n\nor you can look at the video lecture at Lynda.com \n\nhttps://www.lynda.com/Regular-Expressions-tutorials/Using-Regular-Expressions/85870-2.html?org=monash.edu\n\n- - -\n\n## Part 5. Exercises\n\n1.  Write a regular expression to match negative numbers and real-valued numbers, such as -1,023, -10.00, 10.393, and 0.234.\n1.  Write and test regular expressions for validating days. \n    1. Just worry about 0 to 31 by assuming all the months can have 31 days\n    2. Deal with 29, 30 or 31 days, where we distinguish months having 30 days, those having 31 days and assume February always has 29 by treating every year as a leap year.\n2.  Write regular expressions that can handle date format dd/mm/yyyy, deal with 29, 30, and 31 (as in Exercise 2), \n    and make the matched day, month and year accessible with group names.\n- - -",
